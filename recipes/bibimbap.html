    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Bibimbap, a warm Korean rice bowl topped with veggies and meat, is a filling meal that’s always a good idea.  </p>
    <p>“I didn't have thin sliced beef so used ground meat but otherwise followed the recipe,” says tamzie. “It was the best homemade bibimbap so far! Cooking cucumbers and carrots made the difference.”</p>
    <p>“This recipe is delicious as-is but is also easy to alter to your taste,” according to Amandabb. “You can easily change the meat and use pork or even chicken. The veggies are easy to add or substitute to your taste or what you have on hand. I like to add mushrooms and have substituted kale for the spinach and it worked well. My whole family loves this!”</p>
    <p>“I marinated the beef in a Korean sauce I bought at the market, which made the beef delicious,” says Patricia Laglenne. “I had my family make their own bowls so everyone was happy with the ingredients – I added fresh bean sprouts which added a great crunch.”</p>
